# TDA_proteins
This repository contains code for topological data analysis (TDA) based protein classification. We use persistent homology to extract topological features from protein structures and apply machine learning for classification.

# Features
Vectorization techniques used to transform barcodes into meaningful representations - 
Statistical Approach, Persistence Images & Betti Curves for protein structure analysis.

# Classifiers
CNN, tuned Inception, LightGBM

Python implementation using Gudhi, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
